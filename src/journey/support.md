## Ko-Fi

The main method is Ko-Fi, you can either make a one-time donation or a recurrent one.

> (I'm planning stuff to add stuff to my Ko-Fi page mainly services and commissions but haven't got the time yet to plan).

## GitHub Sponsors

I also have GitHub Sponsors active on my profile, which can be found [here](https://github.com/sponsors/ReduxFlakes).

## Liberapay

I've recently created a Liberapay profile so now you can donate through there as well!

If you can't, don't worry, you can [sign my guestbook](https://reduxflakes.atabook.org/) and I'll be really happy to read your message. Or you can also explore my [projects](/projects) and contribute to one of them if you can.
