## Desktop (Windows 11)

### Software (most to least used)

- Brave (thinking of moving to Firefox once again)
- Visual Studio and VS Code - Yes Visual Studio as in the IDE, I've tried building desktop apps with web technologies using Tauri and SvelteKit and even though I love it I just end up messing around with the design a little to much and since I use Windows anyway I decided to go with WPF and WinUI 3 through .NET and C#.

- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) - Self explanatory.

- [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org) - Screenshot utility because Windows one is shit.

- [XnViewMP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/) - Photo viewer because Windows one is shit.

- Discord with [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) and [OpenAsar](https://openasar.dev).
