<summary>Why is this website so ugly?</summary>
<p>In my opinion it looks decent enough and it works well enough for my needs. It's also accessible and the little JS is has is optional.</p>

<summary>Why do you care so much about privacy?</summary>
<p>In today's day and age everything is monetisable and most (all) companies do not care about you and only want money, and there's nothing better than to sell all of your <b>personal</b> data to advertisers and AI companies. This makes you lose your control online which I believe is something dangerous not only for me but for anyone that cares a little bit about freedom.</p>

<summary>What you do for a living?</summary>
<p>I've recently finished my CS course which was a bit surprising since the last weeks of school I was really depressed and anxious about everything, then when it ended I got worse since now I didn't get to see any of my friends, because of that I had the idea of killing myself, fortunately I'm still here because of those friends which supported me through it. I also bought a laptop since the only PC I had was offered by school and I had to return it.</p>

<summary>What are your hobbies?</summary>
<p>I do a lot of stuff but I suffer from procrastination and brainrot, but when I get past that I mostly do web development (websites and web apps), design (mockups, branding, web design), software development (<a href="https://surfscape.eu/projects/celer">Celer</a>), music mastering for my YouTube channel, gaming, and finally, staying up until 5am~6am watching Instagram reels</p>
