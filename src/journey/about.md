## The webmaster

Hi, my name is ReduxFlakes, also known as reduc to close friends. I'm a CS student from Portugal that likes music, programming (I'm bad at it though), design (web and software), gaming, and retro tech stuff. I'm an advocate on privacy, FLOSS and freedom of speech.

I mostly do websites, design mockups of software, music remastering (that I upload to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@reduxflakes)), and other projects that I'll never released because I'm too ambitious and I procrastinate a lot :p.

If you want to know what I'm up to check either my [now page](/now) or [my socials](/#on-the-web)!

<div  class="auto-flex button-grid">
  {% for button in buttons.likes %}
  {% if button.url %}
    <a href="{{button.url}}" title="{{button.title}}"><img src="/public/img/buttons/{{button.img}}" alt="{{button.title}} button" width="88" height="31" class="classic-btn" loading="lazy" decoding="async" eleventy:ignore ></a>
  {% else %}
  <a href="{{button.url}}" >{{button.title}}</a>
  {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>




### Tools

> Need to move this to the colophon page

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) - The SSG I use to build this website, helps on cutting the copy/paste and makes things more consistent (great for someone who is perfectionist).
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) - The icons I use across the website.
