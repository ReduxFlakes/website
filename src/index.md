## Welcome

Welcome to my new personal website! Yes, I've redesigned it again since I wasn't "enjoying" my last design/layout, the reason was that, like other Neocities sites, I wanted something special and personal, and the last website was just a minimalist portoflio without any personality, now that doesn't mean the other version was scrapped since I liked the work I did on it, so that means I now have two personal websites, this one and a portfolio based on the older one.
