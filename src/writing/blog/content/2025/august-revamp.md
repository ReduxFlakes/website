## Another redesign!?

Yeah, here we are again, a new revamp/redesign/rewrite, however, I am happy and proud of this one, so let's get to it.

## Layout/Design

For the people that have seen the older revisions of this site might have seen already that the redesign is not that huge, which is true, most of the CSS is still the same and the general structure of the site is similar. This is because the older layout/design wasn't that bad, but there were problems, mainly the code and the folder structure, which were horrid (and still are to a certain point) and demotivated me to keep working on it. This new design is much cleaner, both visually and code wise. The templates are more modular (especially with the new sidebar) and the content has, generally, better structure.

Another _major_ change is the color scheme. I was using gruvbox, and even though I still like it I missed Catppuccin a bit, so I decided to use, and it looks great!

## Navigation

One of the things that hasn't changed a lot is the navigation, I think I've hit gold when I decided to do this type of navbar/menu, so I decided to stick with it, however I did some upgrades, mainly improving the design (necessary because on mobile the hyperlink hitbox was to small) and cleaning up some of the Nunjucks and frontmatter code to make it simpler to add new pages.

## New features

Different from my other redesigns, there is new features, mainly the sidebar I talked about earlier but mainly the stuff that it contains: the Last.FM widget and the to-do list that tracks the current progress of the site (spoiler: it will never reach 100%).

There's also the improved homepage and improved [projects](/work/projects) page.

## Conclusion

Outside of working on this website, I've been working on other projects, mainly SurfScape, which I recently bought a domain for ([surfscape.eu](https://surfscape.eu)) and the Celer toolbox for Windows, which I'm sloooowly porting from WPF to WinUI 3 with surprising success!

So this is it, the long awaited redesign I promised months ago that should've been done in less than 2 weeks.

That's all for today, I'll promise that this time I'll update the site with new stuff frequently.

Thanks for visiting and reading!
