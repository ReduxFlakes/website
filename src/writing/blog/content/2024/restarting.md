I finally got a drop of motivation to restart my personal website once again for the... I don't even know how many redesigns I made so forget it. Anyways, welcome to my new website, inspired by Swiss and minimalism design that I fell in love earlier this year.

My idea with the redesign was mainly to make the site bigger in terms of layout and design so that I could be more flexible but also because up until now my websites didn't really offer anything other than some blog posts and some basic pages, so I wanted to have a platform of some sort where I could share anything I wanted.

## Hi Nekoweb!

Another thing I wanted to do with the revamp was to test other hosting platforms, now this website started on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/site/reduxflakes) which I really do love and I'm gonna keep using it but in recent years there has been a "competitor" (more like an alternative) called [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org/) and you know what that means, this website is now available there as well (depends on where you're reading this, on Neocities, Nekoweb, or even my [RSS Feed]())!

## Closure

So that's all for this revamp, there's been a lot of things happening this year, some good like joining the OSM community back in April, some great like the release of the new website or the spike on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@reduxflakes), and some really horrible like the passing away of my childhood dog that died at the age of 17 (the same age that I have now) because of a tumor which left me really heartbroken, R.I.P Lia (2007 - 2024) fly high great friend and life companion!
