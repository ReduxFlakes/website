## Desktop (Windows 10)

### Software (most to least used)

- Firefox (with [BetterFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox) and [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)).

- Visual Studio and VS Code - Yes Visual Studio as in the IDE, I've tried building desktop apps with web technologies using Tauri and SvelteKit and even though I love it I just end up messing around with the design a little to much so since my main OS is still Windows I'm using Visual Studio so that I can use WPF to build desktop apps.

- [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks) - I only use it for Figma since it's such a huge web app Thorium helps a lot with it's optimization (also Windows 7 support ðŸ˜‹).

- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) - Self explanatory.

- [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org) - Screenshot utility because Windows one is shit.

- [XnViewMP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/) - Photo viewer because Windows one is shit.

- Discord with [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) and [OpenAsar](https://openasar.dev).
