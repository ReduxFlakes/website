## Channels

- [BawBaw](https://www.youtube.com/@BawBawTalks) - This channel appeared on my recommendations as a surprise. It's a recent, small channel, of a guy playing Minecraft while talking about life. It's a awesome channel, with awesome content that tries (with sucess) to recreate the old vibe of YouTube. This has turned into one of my favourites channels!

## Playlists

- [Peak FLDE Content](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGjHXr0nvFe2iXqSIK0_gHB5E22gXcmjr) - Peak chiptune!
- [Best Live](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT46wXTdSpp7-xBPJ9bNc2me4qv9f2x69) - Songs I love performed live!
