Hey, welcome to my blog! This is an introduction post to talk about me and the new redesign.

I always tried making a blog but for some reason I simply couldn't, I mean I tried 10 times probably because I procrastinate a lot as all the developers out there do, am I right? ðŸ˜‰

Anyway, this is my last attempt at making a blog and a website as a whole. I'm a person that gets tired easily, which results in making things from scratch, sometimes from the ground up, resulting in a nice but empty website because of a lack of content.

With the new year I decided to change myself...by procrastinate less, smart right? So I decided to focuse more on content then design, you can actually notice it, the website is pretty basic but that's the point. Most of my inspiration came from the post [A Brutally Simple Site](https://kevq.uk/a-brutally-simple-site/) from Kev Quirk where he talks about [Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/) which sums up everything that I said, raw content instead of complex designs.
