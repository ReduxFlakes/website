If you like my work and have the option to support me monetary, you can donate me trough my Ko-Fi page using the button below :D.

> (I'm planning stuff to add to my Ko-Fi pages since in the future I want to make comissions, offer services, and maybe create a shop even).

If you can't, don't worry, you can [sign my guestbook](https://reduxflakes.atabook.org/) and I'll be really happy to read your message. Or you can also explore my [projects](/projects) and contribute to one of them if you can.
