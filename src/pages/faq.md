<details>
<summary>Why is this website so ugly?</summary>
<p>In my opinion it looks decent enough and it works well enough for what it does and contains, you also need to factor in that I was able to mostly make it responsive considering that the layout is all made using grid areas and most of the design is consistent (thank my prefection).</p>

<details>
<summary>Why do you care so much about privacy?</summary>
<p>In today's day and age everything is monetisable and most (all) companies do not care about you and only want money, and there's nothing better than to sell all of your <b>personal</b> data to advertisers and AI companies. This makes you lose your control online which I believe is something dangerous not only for me but for anyone that cares a little about freedom.</p>

<details>
<summary>What you do for a living?</summary>
<p>Currently I'm on a CS course that delves into software development (Java, Unity), hardware (PC building and fixing), networking (analog and digital signals, web development (PHP and HTML 3/4)), and Office.</p>

<details>
<summary>What are your hobbies?</summary>
<p>I do a lot of stuff but I suffer from procrastination and brainrot (ðŸ’€) but when I get past that I mostly do web development, design (mockups, branding, web design), music mastering for my YouTube channel, gaming, and finally 2am-4am YouTube Shorts viewing.</p>
