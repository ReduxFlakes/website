## What I've been playing

I'm again addicted to Brawl Stars, focusing on griding trophies and ranked. [My profile on brawltime.ninja](https://brawltime.ninja/profile/YRGCY0PJQ).

I've also gone back to playing Kingdom Rush and Mindustry after a long break.

## What I've been watching

2 days ago I decided to revisit Regular Show, one of my favourites cartoons of my childhood, and I'm not disappointed! Currently on half way trough season 2 and I'm loving it!
